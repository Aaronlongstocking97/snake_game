# snake_game

# Overview

I am creating this game to work on my object-oriented design and to further my understanding of programming using the PyGame library.

The game that I wrote is the snake game. This game involves controlling a single block or snakehead by using the arrow keys to move up, down, left, and right. The snake increases in size as he eats the food; if he runs into himself, you lose. Additionally, if the snake runs into the wall, then the game will end.

I created this software because I wanted to test my skills in programming to see if I could make a well-known game that I used to play.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

The tool that I used to create this program was Visual Studio Code.

This program is written in Python and uses PyGame, Collections, Random, Direction, Settings, and Enum libraries.

# Future Work

Here is a list of items I would like to accomplish:

-  Fix the sound created when the snake hits the wall.
-  Create a start menu
-  Create a pause menu
