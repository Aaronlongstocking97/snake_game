# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}
I am creating this game to work on my object oriented design
and to further my understanding of programming using the PyGame library.
{Provide a description the game that you wrote. Describe how to play your game.}

The game that I wrote is the snake game. This game involves controlling a single block or snakehead by using the arrow keys to move up down left and right. The snake gets larger as he eats the food and if he runs into himself then you lose. Additionally if the snake runs into the wall then the game will end.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

The reason I created this software is because I wanted to test my skills in programming to see if I could create a well known game that I used to play. If I could

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}
